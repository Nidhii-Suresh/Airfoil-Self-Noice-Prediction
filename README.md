# Airfoil-Self-Noise-Prediction

## Dataset Info

* The Airfoil-Self-Noise NASA Dataset is obtained from a series of aerodynamic and acoustic tests of two and three-dimensional airfoil blade sections conducted in an anechoic wind tunnel. It comprises different size NACA 0012 airfoils at various wind tunnel speeds and angles of attack. The span of the airfoil and the observer position were the same in all of the experiments.

* The dataset comprises of 1503 Instances and 6 Attributes

## Features 

* Frequency, in Hertzs.
* Angle of attack, in degrees.
* Chord length, in meters.
* Free-stream velocity, in meters per second.
* Suction side displacement thickness, in meters.

## Target
Scaled sound pressure level, in decibels.
